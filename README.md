### Hi there, welcome to my Github page

My name is Abir Islam and I am an aspiring Full-Stack Developer.

### Here are some things you might want to know about me!
- ðŸŽ“ I graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at Temple University on December 2023
- âœ… I had completed my Computer Security & Digital Forensics Certificate by the time of my graduation
- ðŸ”Œ I have previously interned at Comcast
- ðŸ“‚ You can visit my portfolio [here](https://abirislam.com/)

I took a small break after finishing up college, but now I'm back and hungry to code!

### Goals and Milestones

I'm currently learning a handful of things:
- Full-stack web-app development through [Odin](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
- Godot game engine
- C++ (to help facilitate game-making)

I will be blogging about my weekly development soon after I upgrade my portfolio website, which will happen sometime after I finish Odin.
